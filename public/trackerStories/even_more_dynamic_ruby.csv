67657030,Dynamic Ruby - Menu changes based on day of the week,"",3,"Mar 31, 2014","Apr 6, 2014",feature,1,unstarted,"Mar 17, 2014",,,Mike Gehard,"The restaurant owner is very happy with the work so far and business has been good. They are ready to offer different menus based on the day of the week.

Your job is to give them a way to specify what days of the week an item is available in the CSV file.

The system will then only show the items in the menu for that day of the week.

Technical information:
You will need to add a column to the CSV file to hold this information. How you denote that an item is available on a day of the week is up to you.

Your menu should then be initialized with the day of the week so that when you get items from the menu only the ones for that day show up.",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/67657030,
67657632,Dynamic Ruby - Featured Item,"",3,"Mar 31, 2014","Apr 6, 2014",feature,1,unstarted,"Mar 17, 2014",,,Mike Gehard,"The restaurant would like to manage the paragraphs at the top of the page via a text file in the config directory. This file will be read and the paragraphs displayed at the top of the screen.

The file should have one column for the text. The text will display on the page in the order it is in the file.

Technical details:
This is very similar to how the refactoring of the menu items worked. You should write an acceptance test first to make sure you didn't break anything in the refactoring and then implement classes (complete with tests) that read and display the text.",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/67657632,
