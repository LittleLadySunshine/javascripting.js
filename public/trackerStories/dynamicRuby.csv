67435024,Dynamic Ruby - Allow copyright date to change automatically,dynamic-ruby,,,,feature,1,unstarted,"Mar 12, 2014",,,Mike Gehard,"The restaurant owner is very happy with the landing page you have created for them but there is one issue that they didn't think about. 

The year has changed but the copyright year at the bottom of the site is still from last year. They would like it to change each year without having a developer change the page. You decide that you can use ERB to make this work.",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/67435024,,,,"Move public/index.html to public/index.html.erb.

67435776,Dynamic Ruby - Refactor the item list to use a Menu object so changes are easier later on,dynamic-ruby,,,,feature,1,unstarted,"Mar 12, 2014",,,Mike Gehard,"Your view should instantiate a Menu object and ask the object for an array of Item objects. These Item objects have the following attributes:

* name

67435168,Dynamic Ruby - Menu items load from a configuration file,dynamic-ruby,,,,feature,1,unstarted,"Mar 12, 2014",,,Mike Gehard,"Your client would like to not have to call you every time they want to make a change to the menu. They feel confident changing a csv file and nothing else. They would like you to provide a way they can change one text file instead of editing HTML or Ruby code.

The file will live in the config directory within the site and is provided in the repository.

Each menu item has:

A name
A description
A price
An image

You job is to display all 4 pieces of information on the site using HTML tags that make sense. Do your best to make the images look good on the site.",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/67435168,
67435632,Dynamic Ruby - 10% discount on Wednesday,dynamic-ruby,,,,feature,1,unstarted,"Mar 12, 2014",,,Mike Gehard,"Warning: this is a harder problem. Don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away. Ask around for help. If you can't figure out how to test the new functionality for the price method, then just implement the method without the test.

In celebration of hump day and to get more people into the restaurant mid week, the restaurant would like to make all menu items 10% off on Wednesdays. When the date is a Wednesday on your computer (how can you simulate this?), then prices should be 10% off.

Technical requirements:
The discount price should not be calculated in the view. When asking an item object for the price (aka calling .price method on an item), the discount should be reflected in the returned value.",http://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/67435632,,"Hints:
You now have to deal with date dependent code in your tests. In the most obvious implementation, if you run your tests on a Wednesday they will all pass but if you run them on any other day of the week they will fail. You have two options:

1) Somehow freeze time so that you can test the price on Wednesday and on other days of the week. See https://rubygems.org/gems/timecop for one way to do that. It has already been added to the Gemfile so you don't need to do anything to use it.

2) Make the .price method take a parameter that you can ask a question to about if it is Wednesday or not.

Both are valid solutions. You pick which one you want to implement. We will talk about the benefits and the downsides of both in class. (Mike Gehard - Mar 12, 2014)"
